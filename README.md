# Machine Learning

Hello Everyone, this is my Machine Learning modules I have implemented so far.

## Modules

- **Simple Linear Regression**
  - A simple linear regression model to predict values based on a linear relationship between variables.
  
- **Support Vector Regression**
  - A support vector machine algorithm for regression tasks, handling both linear and non-linear data.

- **Decision Tree Regression**
  - A regression model that uses a decision tree to predict outcomes by learning decision rules from features.

- **Random Forest Regression**
  - An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions.

- **Logistic Regression**
  - A statistical model for binary classification tasks, estimating probabilities using a logistic function.

- **K Nearest Neighbor**
  - A non-parametric method used for classification and regression by comparing a point to its k-nearest neighbors.
